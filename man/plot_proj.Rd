\arguments{
\item{high}{A list containing output from Projections() (including a matrix of simulation trajectories) - corresponding to a high bycatch level (this is at the high end of the range defined by the user in the Shiny app)}

\item{med}{A list containing output from Projections() (including a matrix of simulation trajectories) - corresponding to a medium bycatch level (this is at the median of the low and high end of the range defined by the user)}

\item{low}{A list containing output from Projections() (including a matrix of simulation trajectories) - corresponding to a high bycatch level (this is at the high end of the range defined by the user)}

\item{years.plot}{- how many years to plot}

\item{spaghetti}{- either FALSE or a number, where the number is how many simulations to show from the same scenario}

\item{years.to.plot}{- how many years to plot on the x axis}

\item{multiplot}{}
}
\value{
A plot of 50 percent and 90 percent confidence intervals of population projections (if \code{spaghetti ==FALSE}) or a spaghetti plot (if \code{spaghetti ==TRUE}),  from \code{Projections()}.
}
\description{
plots outputs from several projections that result from a Projections() call.
