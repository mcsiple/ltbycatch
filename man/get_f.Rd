\title{Get bycatch mortality rate E that results in a specified depletion}
\usage{
get_f(
  f.start = NA,
  S0.w = NA,
  S1plus.w = NA,
  nages.w = NA,
  K1plus.w = NA,
  AgeMat.w = NA,
  InitDepl.w = NA,
  z.w = NA,
  lambdaMax.w = NA,
  N0.w = NA,
  P0.w = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{f.start}{An initial guess for the bycatch rate E. The default value is E = 0.5}

\item{S0.w}{Calf or pup survival, a numeric value between 0 and 1. (Note: the 'w' suffix indicates that \eqn{z} is in the wrapper fn, and is used inside the function by optim())}

\item{S1plus.w}{Survival for animals age 1 year and older (a value between 0 and 1)}

\item{nages.w}{"Maximum" age, treated as the plus group age. The plus group age can be set equal to the age at maturity +2 years without losing accuracy.}

\item{K1plus.w}{The pre-exploitation population size of individuals aged 1 and older. If this value is unavailable, it can be approximated by using the initial depletion and the estimate of current abundance.}

\item{AgeMat.w}{Age at maturity in years (assumed to be age at first parturition - 1)}

\item{InitDepl.w}{The depletion level to solve for (this is equivalent to 'starting depletion')}

\item{z.w}{The degree of compensation. The default value is \code{z = 2.39}.}

\item{lambdaMax.w}{The maximum intrinsic growth rate}

\item{N0.w}{Numbers per recruit in terms of mature individuals individuals}

\item{P0.w}{Numbers per recruit in terms of aged 1+ individuals individuals}
}
\value{
A single value, the bycatch rate that would lead to the depletion level \code{InitDepl.w}
}
\description{
This function solves for the bycatch rate \eqn{E} that gives depletion level \code{InitDepl.w}. It is used within the \code{Projections()} function to get the stable age distribution at which to start the projections.

\examples{
# Get number of individuals per recruit in terms of mature individuals (\eqn{N0.w})

# Get number of individuals per recruit in terms of individuals aged 1+ (\eqn{P0.w})
P0 <- NPROut$P1r # 1+ nums per recruit
