\title{Get bycatch mortality rate given depletion}
\usage{
get_f(
  f.start = NA,
  S0.w = NA,
  S1plus.w = NA,
  nages.w = NA,
  K1plus.w = NA,
  AgeMat.w = NA,
  InitDepl.w = NA,
  z.w = NA,
  lambdaMax.w = NA,
  N0.w = NA,
  P0.w = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{f.start}{an initial guess for the bycatch mortality rate E. The default value is E = 0.5}

\item{S0.w}{Calf or pup survival, a numeric value between 0 and 1. (Note: the 'w' suffix indicates that \eqn{z} is in the wrapper function, and is used inside the function by \code{optim})}

\item{S1plus.w}{survival for animals age 1 year and older (a numeric value between 0 and 1)}

\item{nages.w}{"maximum" age, treated as the plus group age. The plus group age can be set equal to the age at maturity +2 years without losing accuracy.}

\item{K1plus.w}{the pre-exploitation population size of individuals aged 1 and older. If this value is unavailable, it can be approximated by using the initial depletion and the estimate of current abundance.}

\item{AgeMat.w}{age at maturity in years (assumed to be age at first parturition - 1)}

\item{InitDepl.w}{the depletion level to solve for (this is equivalent to 'starting depletion')}

\item{z.w}{the degree of compensation. The default value is \code{z = 2.39}.}

\item{lambdaMax.w}{the maximum intrinsic growth rate}

\item{N0.w}{numbers per recruit in terms of mature individuals individuals}

\item{P0.w}{numbers per recruit in terms of aged 1+ individuals individuals}
}
\value{
The bycatch rate that would lead to the depletion level \code{InitDepl.w} -- a single value.
}
\description{
This function solves for the bycatch mortality rate \eqn{E} that gives depletion level \code{InitDepl.w}. It is used within the \code{Projections()} function to get the stable age distribution at which to start the projections.

# Get number of individuals per recruit in terms of mature individuals (\eqn{N0.w})
