\title{Calculate relative abundance}
\usage{
abund_rel(traj, zero.traj, K = NA, years.vec = c(10, 20, 50), fulldist = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{traj}{a matrix of trajectories, with rows=nsims and cols=nyears}

\item{zero.traj}{a matrix of trajectories, same as traj but unfished. CHECK to make sure both start at the same simulation, in the app code.}

\item{K}{if calculating abundance relative to K, put in K.}

\item{years.vec}{a vector of years to check abundances at. E.g., how many years after the start of projections do you want to know abundance?}

\item{fulldist}{logical saying whether to return the full distribution of relative abundances or the median of all the relative abundances.}
}
\value{
a vector of abundance relative to K or zero-exploitation where nrows=length of years.vec (10 years after, 20 years, etc.) and ncol=number of simulations.
}
\description{
Calculates the expected abundance relative to zero exploitation, years.vec years after projections start
}
