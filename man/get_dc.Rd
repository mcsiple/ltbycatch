get_dc(
  logit.E,
  S0 = S0.w,
  S1plus = S1plus.w,
  nages = nages.w,
  AgeMat = AgeMat.w,

\arguments{
\item{logit.E}{logit transform of bycatch mortality}

\item{S0}{calf/pup survival}
}
\description{
this is the function to minimize, but needs to be restricted to that yield > 0
All life history params are as above
