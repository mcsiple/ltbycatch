#' Calculate normalized sustainable yield
#' @description This function calculates the normalized sustainable yield, which is used to find MNPL (the population size at which productivity is maximized).
#'
#' @param S0 Calf/pup survival
#' @param S1plus 1+ survival (usually called "juvenile + adult" in literature)
#' @param nages Same as plus group age, called "maximum (lumped) age-class" in Punt (1999) Annex R
#' @param K1plus 1+ carrying capacity
#' @param AgeMat Age at maturity (= age at first parturition - 1)
#' @param z degree of compensation
#' @param E bycatch mortality rate
#' @param P0 unfished nums per recruit - 1+ adults
#' @param lambdaMax maximum steady rate of increase (population growth rate)
#' @param A the Pella-Tomlinson resilience parameter ((fmax - f0)/f0)
#' @param N0 unfished nums per recruit - mature adults
#'
#' @return a single value of normalized yield for exploitation rate E
